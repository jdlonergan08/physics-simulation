This is a physics "simulation" that calculates the energy of a photon emitted or absorbed as an electron jumps from 
one energy level to another in an atom. Initially, the atom of focus is a hydrogen atom. 

In addition to calculating energy of photon, the frequency and wavelength (and in turn potentially color) of the photon can be calculated. 

Further a GUI will hopefully be implemented in the near future
